# Fake-currency-detection
A real-time fake currency detection system built using OpenCV and image processing techniques to differentiate genuine notes from counterfeit ones. The system analyzes key visual features such as texture, watermark, and design patterns to ensure accurate and reliable detection.

🔍 Features

Real-time Detection: Scans and verifies currency instantly using a live camera feed.

Robust Image Processing: Uses texture, watermark, and keypoint feature extraction for accuracy.

Lighting Adaptability: Performs reliably under varied lighting and angle conditions.

Fraud Prevention Integration: Can be integrated with POS systems, ATMs, or mobile devices for automated verification.

🧠 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn (for feature classification)

Platform: Cross-platform (Windows/Linux)

⚙️ How It Works

Capture or input an image of the currency note.

Apply preprocessing (grayscale conversion, noise removal).

Extract features — texture, watermark, and keypoints.

Classify and display the result as Genuine or Fake.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Deep learning integration for improved accuracy.

Multi-currency support and real-time mobile app deployment.

Database for counterfeit pattern learning and tracking.
